# Project-Azrael

The following is a proposal for a demo of a third-person survival horror video game developed in Unreal Engine 5 and playable on PC. 

The objective of the project is to develop a concept for a full production game that takes a new approach to the survival horror genre, and explore the experiences and struggles of video game development. 

Directly inspired by Capcomâ€™s Resident Evil series and partly by the recently announced co-op indie game Blight: Survival, Project Azrael takes the survival horror genre to 15th century Europe during the dwindling era of the Medieval Age. You play as a young inexperienced squire who has been separated from his master after being ambushed by a group of peasants turned monsters. Now you must sneak, scavenge, and fight your way through hordes of these beasts to reunite with your master and discover what calamity has befallen the land.
